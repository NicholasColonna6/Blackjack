# BlackJack

This project is a command line implementation of the casino game BlackJack!

### Objective:
The Player is competing against the Dealer to be the closest to 21 without going over (bust).
 
### How to Play:
1. Download and run the program from the command line 'python blackjack.py'
2. Press 'Enter' when ready to start the game
3. Dealer and Player hands will be dealt
4. Press 'H' to Hit (get another card) or press 'S' to Stay (no more cards).
5. Once the Player finishes their turn, the Dealer's hand will be dealt to completion (greater than or eqaual to 17).
6. If the Player's hand is higher than the Dealer's, without being higher than 21, than the Player wins!
7. Player can opt to play again 'Y' or end game 'N' when prompted

### Future Enhancements:
* Allow user the option to Split or ~~Double Down~~ their hand, similar to the real casino game
  * Implement a betting system
* ~~Implement a score keeper to print the current value of the hand next to the cards~~
* Allow user the ability to keep playing with the same deck of cards or reshuffle
* Allow user the ability to specify the number of decks used in the game
